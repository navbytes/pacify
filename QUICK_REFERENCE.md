## 🧪 Quick Test Guide

### 5-Minute Smoke Test

```bash
# 1. Load extension from dist/ folder
# 2. Test delete active proxy
#    - Activate proxy → Delete it → Verify cleared

# 3. Test rapid switching
#    - Toggle between 3 proxies rapidly → Verify correct

# 4. Test zero quick scripts
#    - Enable Quick Switch → Remove all scripts → Click icon
#    - Should show orange "!" badge

# 5. Check console
#    - Open service worker console
#    - Should see: "Background service worker fully initialized"
#    - No errors
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before

- ❌ Security issue: deleted proxy still active
- ❌ Race conditions on rapid clicks
- ❌ Memory leaks possible
- ❌ Silent errors

### After

- ✅ Chrome proxy always in sync
- ✅ Operations serialized correctly
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ All errors logged

## 🔍 Key Console Messages

Look for these in the service worker console:

**Good signs:**

```
✅ "Background service worker initializing..."
✅ "Event listeners registered"
✅ "Background service worker fully initialized"
✅ "Processing message: SET_PROXY"
✅ "Message SET_PROXY processed successfully"
```

**Expected warnings (not errors):**

```
⚠️  "Waiting for pending proxy change to complete..."
⚠️  "Quick Switch enabled but no scripts in rotation"
⚠️  "Skipping reload for special page: chrome://..."
```

**Should never see:**

```
❌ "Message received during initialization - queuing..." (only during cold start)
❌ Unhandled errors
❌ Promise rejection warnings
```
